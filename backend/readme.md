# Creation of Security Operations Dashboard for Threat Detection with Risk Mitigation Analytics

## Overview

The **Creation of Security Operations Dashboard for Threat Detection with Risk Mitigation Analytics** is a cybersecurity analytics platform that automates the collection, processing, enrichment, and analysis of security-related data. The project integrates multiple cybersecurity datasets, enriches threat information, maps attacks to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, engineers analytical features, stores processed data in MongoDB, and exposes REST APIs for visualization through a dashboard.

The primary objective is to provide security analysts with a centralized platform for monitoring assets, vulnerabilities, threats, incidents, and overall organizational risk.

# Pipeline Description

## 1. Data Collection

The system loads cybersecurity datasets from the `data` directory.

Datasets include:

* Assets
* Vulnerabilities
* Security Events
* Incident History
* Threat Intelligence
* MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

---

## 2. Data Cleaning

The cleaning process performs:

* Removing duplicate records
* Removing empty rows
* Handling missing values
* Standardizing column names
* Normalizing severity values
* Converting timestamps
* Removing duplicate columns

The cleaned dataset is exported as:

```
outputs/cleaned_data.csv
```

---

## 3. Threat Enrichment

Threat enrichment combines security events with:

* Vulnerabilities
* Threat Intelligence

Additional information generated includes:

* Threat Score
* Risk Level
* IOC Match
* Known Exploit Status
* Enrichment Status

Output:

```
outputs/enriched_data.csv
```

---

## 4. MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

Each attack is mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

Generated fields include:

* Technique ID
* Technique Name
* Tactic
* MITRE Mapping Status
* MITRE Score

Output:

```
outputs/mapped_data.csv
```

---

## 5. Feature Engineering

The system generates features such as:

* Threat Score
* CVSS Score
* Incident Frequency
* Historical Risk
* Patch Age
* Asset Risk Score
* Overall Risk Score
* Risk Category

Output:

```
outputs/engineered_features.csv
```

---

# MongoDB Collections

The processed datasets are stored in MongoDB.

Collections include:

```
assets

vulnerabilities

security_events

incident_history

threat_intelligence

mitre_mapping

enriched_events

mapped_events

engineered_features

# Outputs

During execution, the pipeline automatically generates:

```
outputs/
│
├── cleaned_data.csv
├── enriched_data.csv
├── mapped_data.csv
└── engineered_features.csv
```

These files help validate each stage of preprocessing before storage in MongoDB.

## MongoDB setup (required)

The current version uses MongoDB as the real persistence layer. On first backend startup, the bundled CSV datasets are automatically imported into `ThreatDetectionDB` when the collections are empty.

Collections created from the bundled data:
- `security_events` (1,800 records)
- `assets`
- `vulnerabilities`
- `incident_history`
- `threat_intelligence`
- `mitre_mapping`

The AI prediction repository also uses the same database for `threat_predictions`.

### Local MongoDB
Install MongoDB Community Server and MongoDB Compass, make sure the MongoDB service is running, then start Flask. The default URI is `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/`.

### MongoDB Atlas
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `MONGO_URI` to your Atlas connection string. Keep `DATABASE_NAME=ThreatDetectionDB`. Never commit `.env` to GitHub.

### Verify persistence
After starting Flask, open:
- `GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/health`
- `GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/database/status`

The database status endpoint returns the MongoDB database name and document count for every collection.

To manually re-seed the six bundled source collections:
```powershell
python database/seed_mongodb.py
```
To replace those collections with the CSV snapshot:
```powershell
python database/seed_mongodb.py --force
```
